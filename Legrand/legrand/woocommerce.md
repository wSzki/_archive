Based on Wordpress
Open Source, _**Highly Customizable**_


## PLUGINS

### Payment
---

https://woocommerce.com/products/stripe/

    The Stripe plugin for WooCommerce allows you to accept payments directly on your store for web and mobile. With Stripe, customers stay on your store during checkout instead of being redirected to an externally hosted checkout page, which has been proven to lead to higher conversion rates.


### Checkout Fields
---

Customize your Checkout Fields via your admin panel
The checkout field editor provides you with an interface to add, edit, and remove fields shown on your WooCommerce checkout page. Fields can be added and removed from the billing and shipping sections, as well as inserted after these sections next to the standard ‘order notes’.

The editor supports several types for custom fields including text, select, checkboxes, and datepickers.

### Checkout Add-ons

Easily Offer Free or Paid Add-ons and Services at Checkout
The core WooCommerce checkout process covers all of the basic fields shops needs to place an order, but what if your shop needs to offer services or additional products only at checkout? That’s where WooCommerce Checkout Add-ons comes into play. This extension allows you to add several additional options to your checkout page and determine which are free or paid. You can also sort and filter orders based on your shiny new options.
