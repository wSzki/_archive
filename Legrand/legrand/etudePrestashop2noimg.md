## [SOME NEGATIVE REVIEWS](https://www.capterra.com/p/134005/PrestaShop/)

> Cons: - module in PrestaShop addons is very low quality - no integration with professional solutions (eg. PimCore) - no great SEO addons

> Breaking points with enormous endeavor, huge expense on framework yet you won't pay for programming. It very well may be hard to redesign real forms, as you need to custom modify all your code and modules. It's moderate, you need to spare your advancement a few times in light of the fact that not generally spares what you do, not excessively prewar web formats.

> It lack of integration options compared with other options. It doesnt have a lot of plug ins regarding data analitycs.

> Cons: Dozens of employees funded by selling modules. Next to nobody fixing bugs because it's not in their interest. Look for a solution to an awkwardness with the default one page checkout, for example, and you see threads years-old with unresolved problems, even when the solution is just a line or two of code. For example the code that shows something of the payment methods before a user has selected a country to confirm the payment amount. Or one I discovered by mistake - if you manage to hack your way through the order form, simplifying it and forcing it to use guest checkout - Prestashop refuses to accept a repeat customer with the same email address. It requires each customer to open an account. The renamed forked version, I discovered while doing this, is fixed; it allows customers to remain "guest" and for two to have the same email address. Changes to the software seem to come down from the top of the hierarchy rather than up from the needs of users. For example version 1.7 has less free built-in features than version 1.6 and a different system for running themes - symphony instead of smarty. As though any shopkeeper wants to know this, or pay module developers to know it so that they can offer cheap or free modules.

## [SOME MORE NEGATIVE REVIEWS](https://www.merchantmaverick.com/reviews/prestashop-review/)

> Bugs & Glitches: Modules don’t always work with each other and upgrades don’t always go smoothly. You can expect to do some problem-solving.

 > Additional Expenses: There really is no such thing as free. You’ll have to pay for integrations that are typically offered for free on other platforms, and you’ll have to pay for web design and web hosting. You’ll also probably have to hire a developer.

> Support is expensive.

> Some themes and modules are outdated.

> Platform takes lots of work to set up.
